1. What is the job of the Linker?
  The linker combines one or more object files produced by the compiler into a
  single executable (or shared library). Its responsibilities include:
  - Resolving symbol references between object files (matching calls to definitions).
  - Relocating code and data by patching addresses so object files can coexist in
    a single address space.
  - Combining sections (text, data) and producing the final binary image.
  - Optionally performing optimizations (like dead code removal) and producing
    shared libraries or position-independent code when requested.


2. The Loader
  The loader (part of the OS) is responsible for preparing and starting a program
  at runtime. Key tasks include:
  - Loading the executable file into memory (mapping program segments).
  - Resolving dynamic symbols by consulting dynamic linkers and shared libraries.
  - Setting up the process stack, heap, and registers (including program counter).
  - Transferring control to the program's entry point so it begins execution.
  Tools like `ldd` show which shared libraries will be consulted by the loader.

3. Process Creation: The Cloning Machine
Demonstrated by: process_creation.c
This code demonstrates how an operating system creates new processes using a system call named fork().
When the code runs and hits the fork() line, the operating system takes the currently running program and makes an exact duplicate of it. Suddenly, you have two programs running at the same time:
The Parent: The original process.
The Child: The new copy.
The code distinguishes between them by checking the pid (Process ID). If pid is 0, the code knows it is acting as the child; if pid is greater than 0, it knows it is the parent.

4. Makefile
  A Makefile is provided that builds all examples and has helpful targets such as
  run_process_creation, run_linked_program, run_simple_program, and ldd_simple.
